    <p>Hello! My name is Megan Mason, I am a 20-something year old from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg,_Florida>St. Petersburg, Florida</a> and I have recently relocated to Atlanta, Georgia from Tallahassee, Florida.
      I have undergone a personal journey this past year and I am so excited to join this cohort and make a big change in my life! Outside of programming, you can find me hiking with my pup, Sadie, or curled up on the couch with a good book.
      I'm currently reading The Warmth of Other Suns by Isabel Wilkerson and I can't recommend it enough. It should be required reading!
